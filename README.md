## Installation

Clone repository using Git (or otherwise):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jchen324/invento.git
```

Navigate to project:
```bash
cd invento
```

### Backend

To install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

In the `server` folder create a `.env` file  with the following contents:
```bash
MONGO_STRING="mongodb+srv://terry2017530749:AN7a3TZrQEaLlZqr@invento.xnyzlyn.mongodb.net/invento?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
ADMIN_KEY="1234"
```

Also in the same folder, create a `.env.test` file with the following contents:
```bash
MONGO_STRING="mongodb+srv://admin:admin@invento.xcddxcm.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=invento"
ADMIN_KEY="1234"
```

### Frontend

To install dependencies for frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

## How to Run The Tests

### Backend Tests
Go to server folder 
```bash
cd server
```

Run the test via Vitest UI with coverage report
```bash
npx vitest --coverage --ui
```

You will then be directed to a web UI where all the backend tests will be run. The coverage report can also be viewed on this web UI.

Go to server folder 
```bash
cd server
```

Run the server with frontend test database
```bash
npm run dev:test
```

Start a second terminal and go to client folder
```bash
cd client
```

Run the client server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Start a third terminal and go to client folder
```bash
cd client
```

Run the Cypress component and e2e tests on command line
